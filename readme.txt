SmartDebuffCheck is a simple addon to check if your target has the proper debuffs applied, taking into consideration the raid composition. 
Originally written by Snelf and currently maintained by Dekos. 

Check the top of SmartDebuffCheck.lua to : 
- Add or remove allowed debuffs
- Add or remove 'dangerous' bosses that require Demo Shout and Thunderclap (if using the default settings)
- Change the default settings that are applied when the addon is first loaded, or after a /sdc reset
